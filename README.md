# Media-Company-Viewership-Analysis-MLR
## Project Overview

This project analyzes the decline in viewership of a show by a digital media platform similar to Voot, Hotstar, and Netflix. Through Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), we aim to identify factors that influence this trend and derive strategies to potentially reverse it.
