# Media-Company-Viewership-Analysis-MLR
## Project Overview

This project analyzes the decline in viewership of a show by a digital media platform similar to Voot, Hotstar, and Netflix. Through Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), we aim to identify factors that influence this trend and derive strategies to potentially reverse it.

## Analysis Approach

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explore data distributions, correlations, and trends to understand underlying patterns.
  
- **Data Preparation:** Encode categorical variables and scale numerical features for modeling.
  
- **Model Building:** Initiate with a single predictor, progressively adding variables to the model. Adjust the model by systematically adding or removing variables based on performance metrics.
  
- **Feature Evaluation:** Manually eliminate features based on statistical significance and variance inflation factors (VIF) to optimize the model.
  
- **Residual Analysis:** Investigate residuals to ensure the modelâ€™s assumptions are met and to refine model accuracy.
  
- **Prediction and Strategy Formulation:** Utilize the model to make predictions and formulate strategies to counter viewership decline.
